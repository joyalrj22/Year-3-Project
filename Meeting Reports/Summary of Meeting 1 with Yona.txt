Lit review:
start off with broad, what is emotion, categories of emotion, why we're using regression and continous instead of classifying discrete,
then move onto more specific, end with implementation stuff like neural network type etc.

Project plan: basically a gantt chart

features are just points on a graph of likert scale vs time, points averaged over time, correlation coefficients are different measures e.g. eGeMaps or FAUs
that measure how close predicted is to actual feature, i.e. closer to 1 is better
Data set provides deep feature, you extract your own and try (but probably fail) to beat it (get a higher correlation coefficient).
Likert scale obtained by combining results of patient survey of current emotional state (not very accurate or comparable), but alternative is use of a lot
of sensors and stuff.
Higher point on graph = happier

training and dev in hungarian/german, test in chinese 

yona will ask toby what he means by technical evaluation of state of the art (is it a thesis or a diss or what?)

Audio and Video are treated seperately.
Use of Python reccommended
