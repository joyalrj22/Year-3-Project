	in-the-wild vs in-the-lab
	-discrete emotion (5 categories)
	- Emotional state: vector of continous emotional dimensions e.g. valence, arousal

- Automatic emotion recognition
	 -- among discrete categories
	 -- continous dimensions

- Emotional representation models
	- Classification methods for discrete
	- Regression methods used to infer emotional state

- What is a neural network, deep features etc
	--explain svrm as well
	-- why neural is better than svm
	-- neural nets:
		- Statistical measures to summarise LLDs (Features)
		- Correlation Coefficients
		- Possible issues: overfitting, exploding/vanishing gradient
		- Types of neural networks: CNNs, LSTM, recurrent, Gated Recurrent Unit , Attention based networks etc.
