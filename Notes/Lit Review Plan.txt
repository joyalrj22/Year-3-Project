	 -- among discrete categories
	 -- continous dimensions

- Emotional representation models
	- Classification methods for discrete
	- Regression methods used to infer emotional state

- In-the-lab vs. in-the-wild data

- What is a neural network, deep features etc
	--explain svm as well
	-- why neural is better than svm





Themes
- Regression methods vs. classification methods
- Statistical measures to summarise LLDs (Features)
- Correlation Coefficients
- Possible issues: overfitting, exploding/vanishing gradient
- Types of neural networks: CNNs, LSTM, recurrent, Gated Recurrent Unit , Attention based networks etc.
